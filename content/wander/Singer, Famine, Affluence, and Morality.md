# Salient Points

- **accusatory language**
	- other philosophical works are more concerned with the argument; this author is bringing in his convictions to the table.
- responsibility lies on the individual, but also government
- **proximity problem response**: proximity is a form of *discrimination*
	- furthermore, we now live in a *global village* with instant communication. what are your excuses? (even more relevant in the 21st century)
- **millions of others problem response**: that there are others doesn't change what *you* ought to do
	- relatedly, **what if i'm the only one problem response**: just do until you can, the point of marginal utility. believe that others are as well.
		- *timing and expectation*: overdonation problem only arises if everyone donates simultaneously
		- *different circumstances*: later doners know how much more donation is needed, can play by ear
		- *outcome of action*: results would be optimal if everyone did what they ought to, but probably suboptimal if we assumed things of each other
			- sounds stoic, do the best given what you can control ^35d121

# Main Argument

C1: **the way people in relatively affluent contries react to a situation like that in Bengal cannot be justified.**

C2: **our moral conceptual scheme and way of life needs to be altered**

- P1: suffering and death from lack of food/shelter/medical care are bad.
- P2: if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, *without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance*, we morally ought to do it.
	- italicized: causing anything else comparably bad to happen, or doing something that is wrong in itself
	- note:
		- gives no account of proximity or distance
		- am i only person who can help, or one among millions?

# Notable Effects/Objections

- **charity = duty**
	- thank you for your generosity? no thanks.
	- let's condemn people who don't give.
	- your new clothes = one more dead body
	- no *super-erogatory* (act which would be good to do but not wrong not to do)
- O1: **too drastic!**
	- well, this wasn't supposed to be morally neutral.
	- there is an explanation  for this…
		- moral attitudes are shaped by **needs** of society
		- giving is not a **need**
		- but this is an explanation, not a **justification**.
		- lain: morality ***is demanding***.
- O1.5: pick one or lose both - moral code far beyond layman's capacity causes breakdown of compliance
	- where do we draw the line, man?
	- this is relevant to what we should require from others, not what we ourselves ought to do
		- again, the **stoic** is present here
- O2: do we have to be working full time to increase the balance of happiness over misery?
	- well, it seems like we kinda have to, at least for now.
	- it sounds like a you problem.

> [!quote]- Thomas Aquinas on Famine, Affluence, and Morality
> 
> Now, according to the natural order instituted by divine providence, material goods are provided for the satisfaction of human needs. Therefore the division and appropriation of property, which proceeds from human law, must not hinder the satisfaction of man's necessity from such goods. Equally, whatever a man has in superabundance is owed, of natural right, to the poor for their sustenance. So Ambrosius says, and it is also to be found in the Decretum Gratiani: "The bread which you withhold belongs to the hungry; the clothing you shut away, to the naked; and the money you bury in the earth is the redemption and freedom of the penniless.

# Some more salient points

- overseas aid should be a government responsibility, not mine
	- i don't even agree with this. it starts from you, my friend.
- famine relief is a mere postponement; population control is the deeper problem
	- then just support people supporting population control
- how much should we be giving away?
	- until we reach the level of marginal utility
		- marginal utility: level at which, by giving more, I would cause as much suffering to myself or my dependents as I would relieve by my gift
	- value/necessity of economic growth is questionable
- **fuck it. what if we all just lived like monks?**
- final point: all the philosophical discussion, just cut it out. if you take the conclusion seriously, act on it, and if not, whatever.

# Act vs. Rule Consequentialism

Related to the two points regarding stoicism, is Singer more concerned with the global, or local? Seems to be both.

==**big question: more dehumanizing to let die, or more dehumanizing to sacrifice myself?**==
