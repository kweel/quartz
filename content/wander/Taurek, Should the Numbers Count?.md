**Driving Question**: If resources are limited and choices must be made, should numbers play a significant role in making a moral decision?

## Special considerations

**Dilemma**: I have a supply of some life-saving drug. One of the six (say, David) requires *all* of the drug to survive. Each of the other five requires only $\frac{1}{5}$ of the drug. What should I do?

- Maybe "other things being equal"/"special considerations apart" isn't so easy:
	- What if the one person was about to impact the welfare of an *unusually large number of people*?
		- And on top of that, what if the other five were driveling old people or five idiot infants?
			- No. This is still a *special consideration* that you must set apart.
- Fine. Then if I am friends with David, and not with the others, is it wrong for me to give all my drugs to David?
	- This is different, because the "special consideration" now is not facts about David, but my relationship to him.
		- But your relationship still does not make a difference in what you are *morally required* to do.
- Ok. Then what if I had a contract with someone in advance to override what I would do?
	- Well, your contract still a special obligation.
- Perhaps set $x$ has a special obligation to set $y$â€¦ it never ends.
	- So then, **why do I still feel *not* wrong when I give all my drugs to my friend David?**

**Solution**: I would save David, because *my concern for his well-being is simply greater* than my concern for the well-being of the others. It's not really about moral requirement, more about *personal preference*.

- For example, what if David owns the life-saving drug, and I must convince him to give it to the other five?
	- Me: David, it sucks that you should die, but it sucks even more that the other five should die.
	- David: Sucks even more? For who? For me anyway, it sucks the most that I die. And in their shoes, I wouldn't ask them to save my life because I'd do the same.

**Taurek's view**: one of the five making a utilitarian appeal to David is *absurd*â€”"our sum of net happiness compared to yours is greater" would be a ridiculous thing to say to David.

i.e., $A$, it doesn't *really* matter what you think.

## C: But what ifâ€¦

**Dilemma**: $A$ can save $B$ at the cost of her arm, but $A$ can spare her arm and let $B$ die.

**Taurek's reply**: You are still not morally permitted to favor saving $B$. If the cost $A$ pays to save $B$ lessens, you are still not morally permitted to save $B$, but at least $A$ would be more inclined to spare his loss.

I think that what makes this argument strong is the impossibility of reconciliation of differences in attitude among people. Even if a collectivist were to prefer saving the other at the cost of harm towards me, this argument makes it permissible, while a utilitarian's argument wouldn't. 

"When it actually came to that, would you really?"

## What would Taurek do? (WWTD)

Back to the original dilemmaâ€¦

**Taurek**: Since I can't save everyone, why don't I flip a coin? 50-50 for everyone?

**Objection**: Other things being equal, it's definitely a worse thing that five people die than this one should.

**Taurek's rebuttal**: How many more times should I tell you that it doesn't matter what I think? I can only make a decision based on whether I am prepared to qualify my argument by explaining to who or for whom would be a worse thing.

**Objection**: That is true, but it's irrelevant. Morally speaking, you should save the five anyway.

**Taurek's rebuttal**: My judgment *for this person* or *for this group*, no matter what I choose to do, is not one that expresses a *preference*. But sure, my *impersonal perspective*, *irrespective of any person or group*, would express a *preference*. They are two different things, and I cannot give such an impersonal evaluative judgment for this situation.

In the situation where David is my friend, I would give my drugs to him, but will not elevate the claim that such a *preference* is a universally binding evaluation.

Furthermore, in securing David's survival, I violate no one's rights. (murkyâ€¦ how about racism?)

**Objection**: But surely the numbers must count for somethingâ€¦ What if it were saving 50 people or saving 1?

**Taurek's rebuttal**: I'd still flip a coin. Mere additions of numbers doesn't change anything. Humans are not objectsâ€”their lives don't hold equal value, and they are terrified of the things that will happen to them. "**It is the loss to the individual that matters to me, not the loss of the individual.** ðŸ«³ðŸŽ¤"

## The captain's dilemma

In this case, since the resources that the Coast Guard captain has is not of his own, he is bound to policy for the use of that resource agreeable to those whose resource it is.

But consider this: if all inhabitants on the island were to invest in an evacuation ship with a policy that would save the larger number in trade-off situations, the policy does not give equal weight to the interests of every would-be shareholder (individualistic). In such a case, it would be ridiculous for a northerner to appeal to morality that they should live to the southerner.

**Taurek**: This is how most people will think. Isn't curious then, that many of the same people will think otherwise when setting out a *policy*?
