What if I thought, time *is* on my side?

Given duty $x$, why do I confine myself to think that it takes $t \in T$ to fulfill that duty? What if $T$ is infinite? What if $x$ is the single most important duty in my life, or one that lasts my entire lifetime?

I see that it is sometimes relieving to think about "things I need to do" at a much greater time scale. Take my Statement of Purpose writing for example—it's in the name, a statement of purpose does not have to be some grand argument for what I will spend the rest of my life doing at one moment, it is simply something to figure out more and more over the course of my life as a researcher. It shifts my perspective to understand that it actually isn't graduate school that I am writing this essay for, it's for myself—and its value simply lies in the research potential that I have, which the university may choose or not choose to uphold.

Same should be true for faith. Urgency is not conducive here, I don't need to figure everything out. Hell, it might even be good for me if I start all over again and build up from the foundation, questioning every assumption that I've made thus far. Here, $t$ is even more contingent. If theory is that faith is something I do not attain on my own and instead given to me, $t$ really isn't dependent on me. Should I stray or not stray, it will come when time is due. It may already have come—it just might take me a while to get used to it.

I will be testing this "time is on my side" theory out for the next few days/weeks.
