[[(im)Proving myself]]

I am coming to terms with my long-standing doubts about a religion that has been long been a part of my life—Christianity.

My role as various things in Chrisitian and church communities on campus has made it difficult to really address these doubts. But as I am nearing winter break, and the beginning of what might be the last semester of college that I ever experience, Christianity is something that I want to get straight.

I've had a sense that lots of beliefs I have about Christianity are deeply misaligned with what it really is for a while now. And the biggest driver of this hunch is that too much of what I do as a Christian is driven by guilt and religion.

I have learned the ways that my life was supposed to change once I become a man of Christ—receive love so deep that I feel very little resistance to being celibate (and resistant to any other temptations in life); read the Bible every morning and have deep, spiritual experiences with the text that just ruminates in my head throughout the day; enjoy the entirety of what I used to enjoy in relationships with people and even more; have the direction of my life in full alignment with God, being able to listen to God on what to do at every crossroads. The list goes on.

What my friend helped me notice from this list is that they aren't inherently bad things. In fact, they truly are the ways in which people's lives change once they 'meet God.' But 'meeting God' is the predicate from which all these conclusions follow, and one that I had always been doubtful of having experienced.

In these seasons of doubt, I would often be overwhelmed by a wave of guilt. I must be doing something wrong, God must have reached out to me and it is just the way of my being that is misaligned that isn't leading me to where I am supposed to be. It was really easy to blame myself, 'repent', and move on from the situation.

(the use of single quotes here for certain words/phrases is to denote my lack of understanding what it truly means and still doing it because I think it is what I am supposed to do)

I am in a bit of a rebellious mood, and I am considering experimenting with not feeling guilt from this situation at all. And something interesting that I've been noticing is, guilt is both something that cannot be changed by willpower and also something that I put onto myself. Perhaps what is helping with my guilt slowly lifting away is my rebellious state—I am truly willing to rewrite the neural pathways in my brain that has taught me I must be doing something wrong at this moment.

This document will be a table of contents in which I show various experiments of thoughts in my head that is challenging these long-standing doubts, with the goal being to get rid of the guilt that usually follows such doubts. I will be approaching it from how much of these doubts I can lead to happiness instead of guilt with as little religious interference as possible, but this is something that is subject to change as I continue on with this experiment.

I think this will take a while, but after I am done, I am excited to see where I will be. Fortunately, I have a weird feeling that I will be back to where I started. Hopefully with a new heart.
