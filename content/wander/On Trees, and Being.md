The simple act of *being* is what I find to be most difficult during seasons of restlessness in my life. I am in such a season.

Coincidence or not, a dear friend of mine brought up what trees mean to him. To my question, "what does worship mean?", he said, "to be with God." He used the imagery of trees to help me see what worship means to him. Trees are still, solidly planted in the ground with roots that spread itself deep and wide. But they are not afraid to sway as the wind blows. Instead of resisting, it simply moves back and forth as the wind moves. It can simply *be*, even in the midst of winds, rain, and snow blowing in its way.

It also changes with the seasons, just like we do. At times its leaves are green and luscious, but at other times its leaves dwindle and fall as the weather gets cold. But it is patient. It doesn't try to change anything that it cannot change. It has no trouble waiting for the snow on its branches to melt away, for sprouts to shoot from the ground, for flowers to bloom. Its endurance is constant. Patiently waiting for what the next season might bring it.

Perhaps our lives are not as monotonous as a tree. No matter how much I love this analogy, my life shall not be reduced to a tree. But,

> Wisdom is a tree of life to those who embrace her;  
> happy are those who hold her tightly. (Proverbs 3:18, NLT)

and

> My servant grew up in the Lord’s presence like a tender green shoot,  
>     like a root in dry ground.  
> There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance,  
>     nothing to attract us to him.  
> He was despised and rejected—  
>     a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief.  
> We turned our backs on him and looked the other way.  
>     He was despised, and we did not care.
> 
> Yet it was our weaknesses he carried;  
>     it was our sorrows that weighed him down.  
> And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God,  
>     a punishment for his own sins!  
> But he was pierced for our rebellion,  
>     crushed for our sins.  
> He was beaten so we could be whole.  
>     He was whipped so we could be healed.  
> All of us, like sheep, have strayed away.  
>     We have left God’s paths to follow our own.  
> Yet the Lord laid on him  
>     the sins of us all.
> 
> He was oppressed and treated harshly,  
>     yet he never said a word.  
> He was led like a lamb to the slaughter.  
>     And as a sheep is silent before the shearers,  
>     he did not open his mouth.  
> Unjustly condemned,  
>     he was led away.  
> No one cared that he died without descendants,  
>     that his life was cut short in midstream.  
> But he was struck down  
>     for the rebellion of my people.  
> He had done no wrong  
>     and had never deceived anyone.  
> But he was buried like a criminal;  
>     he was put in a rich man’s grave.
> 
> But it was the Lord’s good plan to crush him  
>     and cause him grief.  
> Yet when his life is made an offering for sin,  
>     he will have many descendants.  
> He will enjoy a long life,  
>     and the Lord’s good plan will prosper in his hands.  
> When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish,  
>     he will be satisfied.  
> And because of his experience,  
>     my righteous servant will make it possible  
> for many to be counted righteous,  
>     for he will bear all their sins.  
> I will give him the honors of a victorious soldier,  
>     because he exposed himself to death.  
> He was counted among the rebels.  
>     He bore the sins of many and interceded for rebels. (Isaiah 53:2-13, NLT)

Christ might be the tree of life which we embrace.
