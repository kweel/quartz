*super rough idea -- still working on my SoP*

preventing the depletion of our precious data landscape, haven't humans done this before? → want a future with sustainable habitat of data generators and data-driven system

current research experience: ugc work helped me understand 1. what makes volunteer commons-regenerating activities sustainable, 2. disparities because of geographic and population bias, forms background and motivation to current research interest → coursework in AI, Ethics, and infosci, as well as double major, built up academic foundation to think interdisciplinarily → still unsure about "I've always been into technology" and industry experience in high school

specifically in finding tangible evidence that there is relationship between quality of models and a continual tending of the shape-shifting landscape of data → necessary for convincing stakeholders in the importance of sustainability for the future of AI

and the embodiment of AI that will prove the contingency of data over time even more than social/spoken data that is salient in the status quo → will prove to be even more relevant considering the pace of AI development
