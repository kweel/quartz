My high-level research objective is to understand technology as a mirror to human goals. Through this lens, my work over the past two years has centered on evaluating user-generated content. Moving forward, I aim to expand this objective into the field of human-centered AI.

In my first research experience with Professor Jacob Thebault-Spieker, I investigated how spatial technologies can contextualize road safety information to users. My contributions to this project were threefold. First, I conducted a literature review of traffic engineering research to identify factors that affect safety, which informed parameters for our safety-first routing algorithm. Second, I constructed the spatial database for the project by merging OSM data and local reports of crashes. Third, I tested workarounds for current geographic and demographic biases in the data, and brainstormed what efforts in the greater crowdsourcing community might help mitigate those biases. Through this project, I realized that the common prescription of increasing data in unspecified ways is not a straightforward solution to reducing existing biases.

Currently, I am exploring the role of rural identity in the use and non-use of user-generated content (UGC) through semi-structured interviews. Some of our participants confirmed our initial hypothesis that there exists a dissonance between the tangibility of connection in rural communities and the disembodied interactions on UGC platforms. However, another subset of participants embraced their value of sharing by producing UGC, broadening the spatial impact of their expertise on farming techniques beyond their physical sphere of influence. The duality of dissonance and embracement revealed to me that technology is a highly personal artifact.

This brings me to the future of UGC platforms. Borrowing from Wikipedia's about page, we have thus far been accumulating the "sum total of human knowledge" in UGC. However, considering the explosion of Hugging Face—the crowdsourced repository of open-sourced ML models and datasets—we may be gearing towards accumulating the sum total of human *intelligence* in UGC. In this new space, I want to research how existing strategies against vandalism, mis/disinformation, and sensitive content may carry over to the next-generation of UGC platforms, and identify areas where they might be inadequate for future challenges. I also want to investigate the consequences of open-source models and datasets becoming ubiquitous, and understand intentions behind both benevolent and malevolent uses to inform platform design decisions.

This future will also bring significant change to our current UGC data landscape. Though some hypothesize that incentives for volunteer work online will be soon be undermined by intelligent machines, I believe that the enduring value of human-to-human connection on UGC platforms will remain important to many. Thus, I want to research plausible methods of predicting which incentives will remain in post-machine-intelligence UGC platforms, and which incentives will not. With this information, I want to make inferences about the shape of our reflection in the future landscape of intelligence on UGC platforms. The representation of humanity in these open-sourced models and datasets will play a pivotal role in ensuring that AI's conception of humanity is as accurate and diverse as the reality it seeks to reflect.
