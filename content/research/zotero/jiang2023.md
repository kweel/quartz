**Title**: A Trade-off-centered Framework of Content Moderation

**Abstract**: Content moderation research typically prioritizes representing and addressing challenges for one group of stakeholders or communities in one type of context. While taking a focused approach is reasonable or even favorable for empirical case studies, it does not address how content moderation works in multiple contexts. Through a systematic literature review of 86 content moderation articles that document empirical studies, we seek to uncover patterns and tensions within past content moderation research. We find that content moderation can be characterized as a series of tradeoffs around moderation actions, styles, philosophies, and values. We discuss how facilitating cooperation and preventing abuse, two key elements in Grimmelmann’s definition of moderation, are inherently dialectical in practice. We close by showing how researchers, designers, and moderators can use our framework of tradeoffs in their own work, and arguing that tradeoffs should be of central importance in investigating and designing content moderation.
