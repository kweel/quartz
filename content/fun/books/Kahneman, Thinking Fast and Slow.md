# System 1, System 2
***System 1***: operates *automatically* and *quickly*, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control

***System 2***: allocates attention to the *effortful* mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.

A reaction to insult:
- system 1 - insult back
- system 2 - take a breath and withold from insulting back

# Attention and Effort
Dilation of the pupil as a "window to the soul"

System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices between options - has the ability to override habitual responses

# The Lazy Controller
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi - *flow-state* researcher
 - "a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems."

When resources for System 2 is depleted, overriding habit becomes harder
- more likely to yield to temptation
- more likely to make selfish choices, superficial judgments in social situations, use sexist language

Interesting: few drinks and restlessness (lack of sleep) have the same effect of resource depletion

self control requires attention and effort.

Baumeister, ***ego depletion***: forcing yourself to do something makes you less willing/able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around
- effortful *mental* activity consumes energy, nervous system consumes more glucose than any other system in the body

The bat-and-ball problem: to avoid exerting a trivial amount of mental work, I chose to follow intuition rather than mental work i.e, the sole involvement of System 1 for mental activity is not enough.
